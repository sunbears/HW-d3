					<h3>About the Data</h3>
					<p><strong>Demographic Variables:</strong> 
						<a href = "https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml">
						U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, 2014 one-year estimates
						</a>
					</p>
					<p><strong>Health Outcome Variables:</strong>
						<a href="https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-2014-Overall/5ra3-ixqq">
						Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2014
						</a>
					</p>

					<h3>Correlations</h3>
					<p><strong>Strong Correlations</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							States' % Uinsured and % Women who have not had their recommended mammogram within 2 years. (R = 0.61)
						</li>
						<li>
							States' % Uinsured and %Unable to see the doctor due to cost. (R = 0.74)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Moderate Correlations</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							States' % Below Poverty and %Unable to see the doctor due to cost. (R = 0.40)
						</li>
						<li>
							States' % Below Poverty and % Self-Reported 'Poor Health'. (R = 0.43)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Slight Correlations</strong></p>
					<ul>	
						<li>
							States' % Unemployement Rate (Civilizan Labor Force) and % Unable to see a doctor due to cost. (R = 0.35)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>Poverty is associated with poorer access to health care, poor utilization of preventative screening
						and poorer overall health.  As one would likely suspect, being without health insurance makes
						one less likely to see the doctor due to cost which in turn is associated with poorer overall health.
						People need health insurance to be healthy! Future studies can explore how state's Medicaid program
						and other safety net services can mitigate the negative impact of povery on health.
